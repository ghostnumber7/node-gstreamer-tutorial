# node-gstreamer-tutorial
In this repo we try to provide a version of the "Basic tutorial" for GStreamer under NodeJS using the great GObject Introspection bindings provided by [node-gtk](https://github.com/romgrk/node-gtk).

## Prerequisites
TODO

## Installation
TODO
(Until the problem in the main repo is fixed, we use our own version of `node-gtk`.)
```
npm install --build-from-source
```

## Usage
Run `node src/tutorial-1.js` to start the first example.
